# How-AI-Sees-Sound

# 🎧 AI That Listens — Waveform & Spectrogram Analysis

# 🚀 Project Overview

This notebook loads an audio file, plays it, and extracts two essential visual representations of sound:

1. Waveform

Shows amplitude over time
→ reveals loudness, rhythm, timing, and dynamics.

2. Spectrogram

Shows frequency over time
→ reveals pitch, timbre, harmonics, formants, and transitions.

These two visuals are the building blocks for future audio tasks like:

pitch detection

emotion detection

singing feedback

instrument note identification

voice cloning

music transcription

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Librosa

Matplotlib

IPython.display.Audio

NumPy

# 🎯 Why This Matters

Audio ML models — especially for singing, speech, and instrument training — rely heavily on spectrograms.
Understanding these visuals is essential for building:

AI singing coaches

Vocal pitch-correction systems

Instrument tuning apps

Real-time emotion detection

Audio classification models
